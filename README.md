hibernatetutorials
==================
The folder will contain the source code of the hibernate tutorials.

The hibernate tutorials are split into two folders:

1. "code" - where all the source code will be kept.
2. "downloads" - where we will find all required files to setup hibernate enviroment in the eclipse

This is it! Good Luck!
